Build a Lunch Picker Program

In this lab, you'll build a program that helps in managing lunch options. You'll work with an array of lunches, add and remove items from the array, and randomly select a lunch option.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

    You should create a lunches variable and assign it an empty array that will be used to store lunch items.

    You should create a function addLunchToEnd that takes an array as the first argument and a string as the second argument. The function should:
        Add the string to the end of the array.
        Log the string "[Lunch Item] added to the end of the lunch menu." to the console, where [Lunch Item] is the string passed to the function.
        Return the updated array.

    You should create a function addLunchToStart that takes an array as the first argument and a string as the second argument. The function should:
        Add the string to the start of the array.
        Log the string "[Lunch Item] added to the start of the lunch menu." to the console, where [Lunch Item] is the string passed to the function.
        Return the updated array.

    You should create a function removeLastLunch that takes an array as its argument. The function should:
        Remove the last element from the array.
        If the removal is successful, log the string "[Lunch Item] removed from the end of the lunch menu." to the console, where [Lunch Item] is the element removed from the array.
        If the array is empty, log the string "No lunches to remove." to the console.
        Return the updated array.

    You should create a function removeFirstLunch that takes an array as its argument. The function should:
        Remove the first element from the array.
        If the removal is successful, log the string "[Lunch Item] removed from the start of the lunch menu." to the console, where [Lunch Item] is the element removed from the array.
        If the array is empty, log the string "No lunches to remove." to the console.
        Return the updated array.

    You should create a function getRandomLunch that takes an array as its argument. The function should:
        Select a random element from the array.
        If successful, log the string "Randomly selected lunch: [Lunch Item]" to the console, where [Lunch Item] is a random element in the array.
        If the array is empty, log the string "No lunches available." to the console.

    You should create a function showLunchMenu that takes an array as its argument and:
        If there are elements in the array, logs the string "Menu items: [Lunch Item], [Lunch Item]... to the console, where each [Lunch item] is one of the elements in the array, in order.
        If the array is empty, logs the string "The menu is empty." to the console.
